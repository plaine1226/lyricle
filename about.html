    <h1>Robin the Creator</h1>
    <p><em>"If the world was ending, I think I would grab some Cinnamon Toast Crunch, a bunch of water, and I'd probably just... I'd probably go crazy."</em></p>
    <p>As Robin painfully finished page 74 of his AP Calculus BC FRQ packet, he thought of the perfect algorithm for the idea brought up by Robert the Innovator. He sat on his office chair and just started typing. Fourty-five minutes later, Lyricle went through the entire life cycle. Robin oversaw her childhood, adolscent years, and now, adult life. And he couldn't be more proud.</p>

    <h1>Robert the Innovator</h1>
    <p><em>"I'm a genius!"</em></p>
    <p>There Robert was, sitting in the middle of his IB Physics class. He thinks to himself, "geez, if Mr. Lipp loves waves so much, why don't I just use my own brain waves to think of something to help the future? The clock ticks: 5 seconds gone. The clock ticks again: 10 seconds gone. Alas, after the longest minute of Robert's life, there she was: Lyricle, born weighing 6 lines of code."</p>
